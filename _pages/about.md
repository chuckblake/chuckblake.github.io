I'm the CTO and co-founder of [LEA](https://getlea.io) — an AI-powered platform helping wealth management firms extract and organize data from complex financial documents.

I've spent my career at startups, wearing every hat from engineering to product to marketing to ops. I like building things from scratch.

On the side, I run the [GetMusic.fm](https://getmusic.fm) ecosystem — tools that help independent artists promote their music on Bandcamp. I also make electronic music as [Corvoco](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3m2iFDte1hP9QY4bEOjMtR) and previously wrote music as [Garlands](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3kNsb1sLtaGAWs91170G6c).

Brooklyn-based. Always building something.
