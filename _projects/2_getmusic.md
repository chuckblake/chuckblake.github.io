[GetMusic.fm](https://getmusic.fm) helps independent artists share free download codes for their Bandcamp releases.

Bandcamp gives artists download codes to promote their music, but there's no good way to distribute them at scale. GetMusic solves that — artists upload their codes, fans claim them, everyone wins.

**Features:**
- Artists can upload and manage download codes
- Fans can easily claim codes and discover new music
- Simple, clean interface focused on the music

Part of a small ecosystem of music tools I've built as side projects.
