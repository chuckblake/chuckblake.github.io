[LEA](https://getlea.ai) is an AI-powered platform that helps wealth management firms extract structured data from complex financial documents.

We automate the painful process of organizing client documents, extracting key data points, and pushing clean information into CRMs and planning platforms.

**What we do:**
- Extract structured data from brokerage statements, tax documents, and estate plans
- Automatically organize and categorize incoming documents
- Push clean data directly into existing systems (CRMs, financial planning tools)
- Transform weeks of manual work into minutes

I'm the CTO and co-founder, building the technology that makes this possible.
